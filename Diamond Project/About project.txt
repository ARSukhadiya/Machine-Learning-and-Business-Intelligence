Diamond Price Prediction using ML Models


Project Objective: 
	The goal of this project is to predict diamond price using machine learning models and identify the most accurate model for this task.

Data set: 
	The dataset used is the Diamonds dataset from Kaggle, which includes various features related to diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more, with the target variable being the price.

	Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds/data).
	Description: 
	Entries: 53,940 Diamonds
	Features: 
		Carat: Weight of the diamonds (0.2 - 5.01)
		Cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
		Color: Diamond color, from D(Best) to J(worst)
		Clarity: Measurement of how clear the diamond is (l1(worst), Sl2, Sl1,VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF(Best))
		x: Length in mm (0 - 10.74)
		y: Width in mm (0 - 58.9)
		z: Depth in mm (0 - 31.8)
		Depth: Total depth percentage (z / mean(x,y)) (43 - 79)
		Table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43 - 95)

	Target variable: Price: In US dollars ($326 - $18,823)

Data Preprocessing:
	Min value of "x", "y", "z" are zero this indicates that there are faulty values in data that represents dimensionless or 2-dimensional diamonds. So we need to filter out those as it clearly faulty data points.
